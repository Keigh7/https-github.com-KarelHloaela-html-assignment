# Responsiveness Approach
For this project, I used a mobile-first strategy. 
This means I designed the layout starting with small screen sizes (like phones) and then added styles for larger screens using media queries. 
This helped me make sure the website works well on all devices, from smartphones to desktops.

I used breakpoints at:

600px – for small tablets

600px – for tablets

1024px and above – for laptops and desktops

#Layout Tools
To build the layout, I used both Flexbox and Grid:

Flexbox was used for simpler, one-direction layouts like the navigation bar and the footer. It helped me align items and space them evenly.

# Design Decisions
Navigation: I used a top navigation bar that changes into a hamburger menu on mobile to save space.

Interactivity: I added hover (Underline) effects on buttons

# Challenges & Ideas Tested
Challenge: Making sure the layout looked good on all screen sizes. I had to test a lot and adjust margins and paddings carefully.
